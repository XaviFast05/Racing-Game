## Description:

On this project, we aimed to create a physics based racing game, with a top down view to test our programming skills. We created a multiplayer game, so you can control two players independetly, having also a CPU able to race against it.

## Features:
This project includes:
- Title screen
- Controls screen, to show each players controls
- Main Gameplay screen:
  
  Here is where all the gameplay works. It starts with a countdown, and when it ends, the karts show up in screen and the game starts.
  Each player has a *turbo* skill with a 10 second cooldown, showing when its ready on the bottom-left side of the screen. In the same spot are shown the laps of each player.
  There is also a podium that updates in real time at the top-right corner of the screen, with a timer next to it.
  
  The main loop of the game consists in a race of three laps. When a player or CPU ends the third lap, the race ends automaticlly, showing the results screen.

  The Laps system works with different sensors placed arround all the circuit, making imposible to do a lap incorrectly.
  Using more sensors, we made that when a player goes out the main track, the friction is bigger, making the players go slower.

- Results screen, showing the best time and the podium, letting the player return to the main screen and start a new race.
